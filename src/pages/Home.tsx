          Hello, I’m a Software Developer based out of Tāmaki Makaurau,
          Auckland, New Zealand.

        <br />
        <p>
          It is an exciting time for me as I pivot into the tech industry, and
          in 2024, I am looking to kickstart my career as a Developer.

          Here you can find work completed during my time at Dev Academy
          Aotearoa as well as other external projects.
        </p>

          You’ll also find other non-development related interests where I spend
          my time, personal information and points of contact.
